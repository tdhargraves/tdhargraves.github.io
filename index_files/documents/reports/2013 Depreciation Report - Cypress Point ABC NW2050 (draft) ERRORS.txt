The errors are:

1. Cypress ABC does not share in maintaining the south fire lane by Bldg. D 
	We exclusively maintain the properties beside all of our buildings 
	and Cypress D and Woodridge maintain the properties beside all of their buildings
	
2. Cypress ABC does not share in maintaining the pavement and parking areas designated to Cypress D 
	nor does Cypress D share in the costs of maintaining the pavement and parking areas 
	designated to Cypress ABC.
	
3. Re Amen 04 (Photo is of Bldg. C). 
	We do not have any steel frame bicycle racks anywhere on Cypress ABC premises.
	
4. Lounge cabinetry is all new as it was renovated in 2012/2013 and will not require replacement in 2020 as stated.

5. Re Mech 01. 
	We do not have any HVAC on the roof as it was all removed in 1999. 
	The thermostats in the common hallways do not work as they have all been disconnected.
	
6. None of the balcony sliding doors were replaced in the 2000/2003 remediation or the 2011 remediation project 
	as they are not subject to the weather and are still in good working order. 
	They will not be replaced in 2017 but will be replaced as they fail to perform properly.
